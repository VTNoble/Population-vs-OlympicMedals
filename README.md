Project 2: Population vs Olympic Medals

This project is an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) project that takes two datasets and merges them for future analysis. The datasets include country population by year and Summer Olympic medals won by year. Future analysis (not undertaken in this exercise) might include studying the relationship between a country's population in a given year and its medal-winning success. 

An overview of this ETL process is as follows:

Project 2: Population vs Olympic Medals

This project is an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) project that takes two datasets and merges them for analysis.

Our datasets are both from Kaggle. One has population data by country and year from 1980 to 2008. The second dataset is a breakdown of Summer Olympic Medals won by country in each Olympic Games.
